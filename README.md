### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

PHP/Symfony Developer for 6 years, I am a geek and I am passionate by IT.
I was the CTO & co founder of Studeal and Wenity which are platforms to manage and engage communities.

I have a strong experience in PHP/Symfony but as CTO of a startup I have to manage all aspects of IT at the beginning (from web development to infrastructure on AWS, web design...).

I managed a team including front and back end engineers and UX/UI designers. My job is my passion, I like what I do and I like to help my clients with their projects.
